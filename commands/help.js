The support team at Photon, recommend the following steps to ensure you can make the best quality workshop icon for your vehicle and/or pack!
â€¢ Take a photo of a good distance away and ensure that the vehicle(s) is the key centre
â€¢ Make a file in either Photoshop, Paint.net or even Paint. And make sure it is 512x512. 
â€¢ Import your image in. 
â€¢ And then just make sure that the vehicle is in the centre and can be seen and highlighted well. 
â€¢ An example of this is this; (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/650845277011312661/1002193930269499402/unknown.png).

Why do we recommend this?
Because it makes your addon seem more professinal and helps highlights your addon. You can add extra bits to your icon, such as text, banners, highlights, etc; as you seem fit!
It also just looks neater then squishing a photo to fit the 512x512 mark.
